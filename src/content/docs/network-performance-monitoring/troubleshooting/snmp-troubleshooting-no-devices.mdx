## Problem [#problem]

You launched an SNMP discovery run but didn't find any devices.

## Solutions [#solutions]

Try one or both of the following solutions:

1. Edit the `snmp-base.yaml` and increase the timeout value for the `timeout_ms` variable.
2. Set all the `cidrs` values to a length of `/32`, which forces a more in-depth discovery process.
