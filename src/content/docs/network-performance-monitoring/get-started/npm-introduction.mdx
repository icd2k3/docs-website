metaDescription: Get started with network performance monitoring with New Relic's Kentik integration.
---

Kentik's integration lets you monitor your Kentik network performance data in several New Relic features.

## Type of network performance data [#network-performance-data-types]

You can monitor the following types of network performance data:

- **SNMP**: Simple network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an applicationâ€“layer protocol for exchanging management information between network devices. To send SNMP data to New Relic, see [Set up SNMP monitoring](https://docs-preview.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kentik-network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/snmp-performance-monitoring).
- **Network flow data**: It captures information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your on-premises network. To send network flow data to New Relic, see [Set up network flow data monitoring](https://docs-preview.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kentik-network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/network-flow-monitoring).

We recommend configuring both SNMP and network flow data for better visibility into your network. This will provide both performance metrics and traffic patterns to troubleshoot and optimize your network.
